description: Well-known Traits and Specifications for use in OpenAssetIO
  hosts and managers.

traits:
  timeline:
    description: Traits related to timelines.
    members:
      Timeline:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes a collection of tracks that evaluate
          concurrently to form layers of references to media. Frequently
          used in non-linear editing environments such as Video and
          Audio post production tools.

      Track:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes a lane or collection of media,
          arranged temporally such that only a single item in the
          collection is active at any given time. Frequently used in
          non-linear editing environments such as Video and Audio post
          production tools.

      Clip:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes the use of some range of external
          media, commonly on a track or timeline. Frequently used in
          non-linear editing environments such as Video and Audio
          production tools.


          TODO(TC) Define any additional properties, and companion
          traits such as 'frameRange' and 'handles'.
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
            description: The name of the clip.

  content:
    description: Traits related to abstract content.
    members:
      LocatableContent:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes an entity whose data is persisted
          externally to the API through data accessible via a valid
          URL.


          The `location` property holds the most applicable location
          of the entity's content for the current process environment
          - considering platform, host, etc. Location is in the form
          of a URL.
        properties:
          location:
            type: string
            description: >
              The location of the entities external content.


              This must be a valid URL so special characters need to
              be encoded.

  managementPolicy:
    description: Traits used in a Manager's managementPolicy response.
    members:
      Managed:
        description: >
          A trait indicating that the data matching the supplied trait set
          is handled by the manager.


          There are three possible policies determined by
          applying/querying this trait:
          * If the response is not imbued with this trait, then the
            Manager has no interest in participating in the management of
            entities that match the queried trait set, for either read or
            write.
          * If the response is imbued with this trait, but the "exclusive"
            property is not set, or set to False, then the Manager would
              like the opportunity to manage the data, but the user should
              still be presented with standard Host UI for the type as an
              option.
            * If  the "exclusive" property is set to true, then the Manager
              takes exclusive control over data with the queried trait set,
              and any standard host interfaces etc should be suppressed.
        usage:
          - managementPolicy
        properties:
          exclusive:
            type: boolean
            description: >
              Determines if the manager exclusively handles data matching
              the supplied trait set.


              If True, then standard host contols should be disabled
              in favour of manager delegated UI. For example, file system
              browsers when determining where to load/save data.


              If False, then standard host controls can be presented in
              addition to any custom manager UI.
