      Timeline:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes a collection of tracks that evaluate
          concurrently to form layers of references to media. Frequently
          used in non-linear editing environments such as Video and
          Audio post production tools.

      Track:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes a lane or collection of media,
          arranged temporally such that only a single item in the
          collection is active at any given time. Frequently used in
          non-linear editing environments such as Video and Audio post
          production tools.

      Clip:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes the use of some range of external
          media, commonly on a track or timeline. Frequently used in
          non-linear editing environments such as Video and Audio
          production tools.

      LocatableContent:
        description: >
          This trait characterizes an entity whose data is persisted
          externally to the API through data accessible via a valid
          URL.


          The `location` property holds the most applicable location
          of the entity's content for the current process environment
          - considering platform, host, etc. Location is in the form
          of a URL.
        properties:
          location:
            type: string
            description: >
              The location of the entities external content.


              This must be a valid URL so special characters need to
              be encoded.
