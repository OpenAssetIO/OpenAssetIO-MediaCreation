# OpenAssetIO-MediaCreation-Package

The openassetio-mediacreation package is automatically generated using
[openassetio-traitgen](https://github.com/OpenAssetIO/OpenAssetIO-TraitGen).

This directory serves as the package directory as far as `setuptools` is
concerned, despite containing no source files.
It's a bit of a compromise, as there is no other purpose for this
directory other than to allow `setuptools` to execute far enough to get
to the point where we can invoke code generation into the build-lib.
See [setup.py](../setup.py) for specifics.
